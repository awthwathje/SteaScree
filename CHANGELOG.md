# SteaScree Changelog

## 1.3.1
* Well, seems like user switching never worked right. Now it does. Games listed in the combobox change on-the-fly when user ID get changed.

## 1.3.0
* Personal name is now shown in the combobox alongside user ID. Useful when a computer is shared among a number of Steam users.

## 1.2.0
* Added check for an updated version. There is an option to never offer updates.
* Tooltips.
* Minor UI improvement.

## 1.1.0
* Implemented checking of dimensions of provided screenshots. If exceptionally large screenshot is detected, now SteaScree offers user a choice to auto-resize it to the maximum size allowed by Steam (maintaining aspect ratio), skip it or even try to upload it nevertheless. Closes issue #4.
* Some bugs fixed.
* Minor UI improvement.

## 1.0.6
* Fixed a bug when screenshots weren't added to the VDF-file if latest copied screenshot was a dupe.
* Minor UI improvement.

## 1.0.5
* Significantly improved quality of generated thumbnails. Now they are even better and smoother, than those generated by Steam itself. Closes issue #1.

## 1.0.3
* Fixed a bug where screenshots with identical creation timestamps were not copied. Now, if the timestamp overlaps for several screenshots, each of them has identical basename, but different incremental integer after the underscore and before ".jpg" extension.
* Button padding are now set in-code for a more convenient binary building across different platforms.

## 1.0.2
* Initially I thought Steam generates missing thumbnails automatically. This was not the case, so since this release SteaScree takes care of them.
* Minor UI improvement.

## 1.0.1
* Game ID combo box is now editable.
* Minor UI improvement.

## 1.0.0
