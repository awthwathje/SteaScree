# SteaScree: Steam Cloud Screenshot Uploader

SteaScree is a simple cross-platform open-source utility app, which makes screenshots, taken without the use of Steam's in-game overlay, uploadable to the Steam Cloud. You just pick pics, a game and SteaScree will do the rest.

**Developer's note**: I am sorry I was unable to motivate myself to improve this app in recent years. The thing is, I don't feel like learning Qt, since the build process for different platforms is a bit cumbersome. I am thinking about rewriting SteaScree for a browser, that is in JavaScript using [File System Access API](https://wicg.github.io/file-system-access), but that'll obviously take time.
